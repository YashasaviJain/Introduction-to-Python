Aim: To understand the basic structure of a Python program and demonstrate the use of variables, data types, and the print() function for displaying output.

THEORY:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simple syntax and readability. It is widely used for beginners as well as in advanced fields like data science, web development, and automation.

Program: A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer what tasks to perform.

Variable: A variable is a named memory location used to store data values. In Python, variables do not need explicit type declaration.

Example:
x = 2
y = [1, 2, 5]

Data Types: Data types specify the type of data a variable can hold.

Integer (int): Stores whole numbers (e.g., 2)

List (list): Stores a collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, 5])

String (str): Stores text (e.g., "Yash")

print() Function: The print() function is used to display output on the screen. The sep parameter is used to specify how multiple values are separated while printing.

Algorithm:
Start the program.

Print the string "Yash".

Print the integer value 2.

Print the list [1, 2, 5].

Assign value 2 to variable x.

Assign list [1, 2, 5] to variable y.

Assign string "Yash" to variable z.

Print the values of x, y, and z each on a new line using the sep parameter.

Stop the program.
